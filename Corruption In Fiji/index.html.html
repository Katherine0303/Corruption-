      <h2>Political Scandals and Institutional Integrity</h2>
      <p>In 2024, the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption (FICAC) faced internal turmoil. Barbara Malimali, appointed as FICAC Commissioner in September, was detained a day after her appointment due to an ongoing investigation into her previous role as chairperson of the Electoral Commission. The incident raised concerns about the commission's independence and the politicization of anti-corruption efforts.</p>

      <p>Additionally, the FijiFirst party experienced a significant upheaval when 17 of its MPs were expelled for voting in favor of salary increases against party directives. This led to the resignation of key party figures and the eventual deregistration of the party in July 2024.</p>

      <h2>Public Sector and Law Enforcement</h2>
      <p>Corruption allegations have also surfaced within Fiji's law enforcement agencies. Assistant Commissioner of Police Sakeo Raikaci acknowledged that low salaries contribute to susceptibility among officers to corrupt practices, especially in the face of lucrative offers from drug traffickers.</p>
      <p>In the corrections system, Commissioner Dr. Jalesi Nakarawa was cleared of criminal wrongdoing after appointing his wife to a nursing position. However, FICAC warned that such actions could be perceived as nepotism, potentially undermining public trust.</p>

      <h2>Civil Society and Public Perception</h2>
      <p>Transparency International's 2024 Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) ranked Fiji 50th out of 180 countries, with a score of 55/100, indicating a moderate level of perceived public sector corruption. This marked an improvement from the previous year's score of 52.</p>
      <p>Despite this progress, a significant portion of the population remains concerned about corruption. According to the Global Corruption Barometer, 68% of Fijians believe that corruption in government is a big problem, and 83% think that ordinary people can make a difference in the fight against corruption.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>While Fiji has taken steps to address corruption, including international collaborations and institutional reforms, recent events underscore the need for continued vigilance and transparency. Strengthening the independence of anti-corruption bodies, ensuring accountability in public service appointments, and fostering a culture of integrity are essential for building public trust and promoting good governance.</p>
